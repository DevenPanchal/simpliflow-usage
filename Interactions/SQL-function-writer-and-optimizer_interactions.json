        "output": "Certainly! Let's start by creating some sample data and then visualizing it using Python. We'll generate some donut charts using the `matplotlib` library.\n\nFirst, ensure you have `matplotlib` installed. If not, you can install it using pip:\n```bash\npip install matplotlib\n```\n\nHere\u2019s a Python code snippet that creates some sample data and generates donut charts:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {\n    'Apples': 30,\n    'Bananas': 15,\n    'Cherries': 25,\n    'Dates': 10,\n    'Elderberries': 20\n}\n\n# Function to create a donut chart\ndef create_donut_chart(data, title):\n    labels = data.keys()\n    sizes = data.values()\n    colors = plt.cm.Paired(range(len(data)))\n\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    wedges, texts, autotexts = ax.pie(sizes, labels=labels, colors=colors,\n                                      autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140, pctdistance=0.85)\n\n    # Draw a circle at the center to make it a donut\n    centre_circle = plt.Circle((0,0),0.70,fc='white')\n    fig.gca().add_artist(centre_circle)\n\n    # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle\n    ax.axis('equal')  \n    plt.title(title)\n\n    # Display the chart\n    plt.show()\n\n# Generate a donut chart for the sample data\ncreate_donut_chart(data, 'Fruit Distribution')\n\n# If you want to create another donut chart with a different dataset, you can do so:\nanother_data = {\n    'Red': 40,\n    'Green': 30,\n    'Blue': 20,\n    'Yellow': 10\n}\n\ncreate_donut_chart(another_data, 'Color Distribution')\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n\n1. We define a dictionary `data` with some sample data.\n2. We define a function `create_donut_chart` that takes the data and a title as input and creates a donut chart using `matplotlib`.\n3. We call this function twice to generate two different donut charts: one for the sample fruit distribution and another for a color distribution.\n\nTo execute this code, copy it into a Python environment and run it. You should see two donut charts displayed, one after the other."
